        Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform runtime environment built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine for executing JavaScript code outside of a browser. You need to recollect that NodeJS isn’t a framework, and it’s not a programing language. It provides an event-driven, non-blocking (asynchronous) I/O and cross-platform runtime environment for building highly scalable server-side applications using JavaScript.
        <br>
        Most people are confused and understand it’s a framework or a programing language. We often use Node.js for building back-end services like APIs, Web App, or Mobile App. It’s utilized in production by large companies like Paypal, Uber, Netflix, Walmart, etc.
